Programming Language: **Python**

Technology stack: **MongoDB, PyMODM, Aiogram, Pyrogram**

**The essence of the project:**
Sift Bot is a tool for tracking content in various chats. The bot is written in Python and uses technologies such as MongoDB for data storage, PyMODM as an ODM, Aiogram for creating a bot interface and Pyrogram for interacting with the Telegram API.

Thanks to the bot's functionality, users can authorize user bot sessions, join the required groups and track messages in them by keywords. The bot provides the ability to create and manage lists of keywords, as well as exclude unwanted words and users from the search.

When a message corresponding to the specified criteria appears in the chats, the bot forwards it to the group where these search for these keywords. This allows the team to quickly track and respond to important information, without the need for a constant presence in many groups.

In addition to this, Sift Bot offers a number of useful features, such as viewing statistics, checking scripts, protecting with a secret phrase and the ability to reboot the bot.
